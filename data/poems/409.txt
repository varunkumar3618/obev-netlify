AH, Chloris! that I now could sit
As unconcern’d as when
Your infant beauty could beget
No pleasure, nor no pain!
When I the dawn used to admire,
And praised the coming day,
I little thought the growing fire
Must take my rest away.

Your charms in harmless childhood lay
Like metals in the mine;
Age from no face took more away
Than youth conceal’d in thine.
But as your charms insensibly
To their perfection prest,
Fond love as unperceived did fly,
And in my bosom rest.

My passion with your beauty grew,
And Cupid at my heart,
Still as his mother favour’d you,
Threw a new flaming dart:
Each gloried in their wanton part;
To make a lover, he
Employ’d the utmost of his art—
To make a beauty, she.
