YOU must be sad; for though it is to Heaven,
’Tis hard to yield a little girl of seven.
Alas, for me ’tis hard my grief to rule,
Who only met her as she went to school;
Who never heard the little lips so sweet
Say even ‘Good-morning,’ though our eyes would meet
As whose would fain be friends! How must you sigh,
Sick for your loss, when even so sad am I,
Who never clasp’d the small hands any day!
Fair flowers thrive round the little grave, I pray.
