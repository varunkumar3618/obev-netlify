YE flowery banks o’ bonnie Doon,
How can ye blume sae fair!
How can ye chant, ye little birds,
And I sae fu’ o’ care!

Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonnie bird,
That sings upon the bough;
Thou minds me o’ the happy days
When my fause luve was true.

Thou’ll break my heart, thou bonnie bird,
That sings beside thy mate;
For sae I sat, and sae I sang,
And wistna o’ my fate.

Aft hae I roved by bonnie Doon,
To see the woodbine twine;
And ilka bird sang o’ its luve,
And sae did I o’ mine.

Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose
Upon a morn in June;
And sae I flourish’d on the morn,
And sae was pu’d or’ noon.



Wi’ lightsome heart I pu’d a rose
Upon its thorny tree;
But my fause luver staw my rose,
And left the thorn wi’ me.
