PUT your head, darling, darling, darling,
Your darling black head my heart above;
O mouth of honey, with thyme for fragrance,
Who, with heart in breast, could deny you love?

O many and many a young girl for me is pining.
Letting her locks of gold to the cold wind free,
For me, the foremost of our gay young fellows;
But Iâ€™d leave a hundred, pure love, for thee!
