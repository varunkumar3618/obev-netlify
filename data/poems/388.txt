O WALY, waly, up the bank,
And waly, waly, doun the brae,
And waly, waly, yon burn-side,
Where I and my Love wont to gae!
I lean’d my back unto an aik,
I thocht it was a trustie tree;
But first it bow’d and syne it brak—
Sae my true love did lichtlie me.

O waly, waly, gin love be bonnie
A little time while it is new!
But when ’tis auld it waxeth cauld,
And fades awa’ like morning dew.
O wherefore should I busk my heid,
Or wherefore should I kame my hair?
For my true Love has me forsook,
And says he’ll never lo’e me mair.

Now Arthur’s Seat sall be my bed,
The sheets sall ne’er be ’filed by me;
Saint Anton’s well sall be my drink;
Since my true Love has forsaken me.
Marti’mas wind, when wilt thou blaw,
And shake the green leaves aff the tree?
O gentle Death, when wilt thou come?
For of my life I am wearìe.

’Tis not the frost, that freezes fell,
Nor blawing snaw’s inclemencie,
’Tis not sic cauld that makes me cry;
But my Love’s heart grown cauld to me.
When we cam in by Glasgow toun,
We were a comely sicht to see;
My Love was clad in the black velvèt,
And I mysel in cramasie.

But had I wist, before I kist,
That love had been sae ill to win,
I had lock’d my heart in a case o’ gowd.
And pinn’d it wi’ a siller pin.
And O! if my young babe were born,
And set upon the nurse’s knee;
And I mysel were dead and gane,
And the green grass growing over me!
