ONLY tell her that I love:
Leave the rest to her and Fate:
Some kind planet from above
May perhaps her pity move:
Lovers on their stars must wait.—
Only tell her that I love!

Why, O why should I despair!
Mercy’s pictured in her eye:
If she once vouchsafe to hear,
Welcome Hope and farewell Fear!
She’s too good to let me die.—
Why, O why should I despair?
