FLY, my Soul! What hangs upon
Thy drooping wings,
And weighs them down
With love of gaudy mortal things?

The Sun is now iâ€™ the east: each shade
As he doth rise
Is shorter made,
That earth may lessen to our eyes.

O be not careless then and play
Until the Star of Peace
Hide all his beams in dark recess!
Poor pilgrims needs must lose their way,
When all the shadows do increase.
