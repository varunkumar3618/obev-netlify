TO live within a cave—it is most good;
But, if God make a day,
And some one come, and say,
‘Lo! I have gather’d faggots in the wood!’
E’en let him stay,
And light a fire, and fan a temporal mood!

So sit till morning! when the light is grown
That he the path can read,
Then bid the man God-speed!
His morning is not thine: yet must thou own
They have a cheerful warmth—those ashes on the stone.
