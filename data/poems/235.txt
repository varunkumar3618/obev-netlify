FLY hence, shadows, that do keep
Watchful sorrows charm’d in sleep!
Tho’ the eyes be overtaken,
Yet the heart doth ever waken
Thoughts chain’d up in busy snares
Of continual woes and cares:
Love and griefs are so exprest
As they rather sigh than rest.
Fly hence, shadows, that do keep
Watchful sorrows charm’d in sleep!
