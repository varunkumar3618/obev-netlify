BEATING Heart! we come again
Where my Love reposes:
This is Mabel’s window-pane;
These are Mabel’s roses.

Is she nested? Does she kneel
In the twilight stilly,
Lily clad from throat to heel,

Fading, will forsake her;
Elves of light, on beamy bars,
Whisper then, and wake her.

Let this friendly pebble plead
At her flowery grating;
If she hear me will she heed?
Mabel, I am waiting.

Mabel will be deck’d anon,
Zoned in bride’s apparel;
Happy zone! O hark to yon
Passion-shaken carol!

Sing thy song, thou trancèd thrush,
Pipe thy best, thy clearest;—
Hush, her lattice moves, O hush—
Dearest Mabel!—dearest ...
