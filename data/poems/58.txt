FINE knacks for ladies! cheap, choice, brave, and new,
Good pennyworths—but money cannot move:
I keep a fair but for the Fair to view—
A beggar may be liberal of love.
Though all my wares be trash, the heart is true,
The heart is true.

Great gifts are guiles and look for gifts again;
My trifles come as treasures from my mind:
It is a precious jewel to be plain;
Sometimes in shell the orient’st pearls we find:—
Of others take a sheaf, of me a grain!
Of me a grain!
