LIKE to Diana in her summer weed,
Girt with a crimson robe of brightest dye,
Goes fair Samela.
Whiter than be the flocks that straggling feed
When wash’d by Arethusa faint they lie,
Is fair Samela.
As fair Aurora in her morning grey,
Deck’d with the ruddy glister of her love
Is fair Samela;
Like lovely Thetis on a calmèd day
Whenas her brightness Neptune’s fancy move,
Shines fair Samela.

Her tresses gold, her eyes like glassy streams,
Her teeth are pearl, the breasts are ivory
Of fair Samela;
Her cheeks like rose and lily yield forth gleams;
Her brows bright arches framed of ebony.
Thus fair Samela
Passeth fair Venus in her bravest hue,
And Juno in the show of majesty
(For she’s Samela!),
Pallas in wit,—all three, if you well view,
For beauty, wit, and matchless dignity,
Yield to Samela.
