COME, let us now resolve at last
To live and love in quiet;
We’ll tie the knot so very fast
That Time shall ne’er untie it.

The truest joys they seldom prove
Who free from quarrels live:
’Tis the most tender part of love
Each other to forgive.

When least I seem’d concern’d, I took
No pleasure nor no rest;
And when I feign’d an angry look,
Alas! I loved you best.

Own but the same to me—you’ll find
How blest will be our fate.
O to be happy—to be kind—
Sure never is too late!
