HENCE, all you vain delights,
As short as are the nights
Wherein you spend your folly!
There’s naught in this life sweet,
If men were wise to see’t,
But only melancholy—
O sweetest melancholy!
Welcome, folded arms and fixèd eyes,
A sight that piercing mortifies,
A look that’s fasten’d to the ground,
A tongue chain’d up without a sound!

Fountain-heads and pathless groves,
Places which pale passion loves!
Moonlight walks, when all the fowls
Are warmly housed, save bats and owls!
A midnight bell, a parting groan—
These are the sounds we feed upon:
Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley,
Nothing’s so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy.
